## The Project


### Project Goals

With the ever growing need to find a simple recipe to cook for you and your family. The idea of myRecipe was created with the intention of creating an application where you can create and view your own or others recipes. With the intention of future development to build tools to allow chefs and restaurants the same ability and have everything in one place.

### Initial Design (Wireframes)

During the initial design phase of the project, wire frames were created to give a visual design idea and an end goal to work towards. With thought and care taken to make the design of the application as responsive and user friendly as possible for all device types. 
Whilst the wire frames may not be accurate to the final deployed project. The application has been adjusted to work and function correctly on all device types. The wireframes were designed to give a core design to the store.

### Home, Shop and User dashboard

The design was intended to be simple and intuitive for the user. To allow them to use the store as intended. Keeping it clean and simple at the same time as giving the user all the information they would need on that page.

###  Support, Dont GnocchIt and Admin Dashboard

Despite there being other pages on the application that are not included in the initial wireframe design. They all followed the core theme of the application and store. This allowed less going back and forth designing new pages in wireframe's, meaning the development of certain features and pages could commence straight away.

With the design of the database being a crucial part of the applications core design it was important to get it right. 

Although not all designs are implemented into the live application is leaving room for future development with the implementation of 'user product rating and comments' and 'individual supplier stores' to allow them to manage their own products and sell on the platform.

## Technology Used

During the development of the app multiple different types of technology was used and utilized to build the final application. 

- HTML - Was used to create the basic web page for the project
- CSS - Was used to style the web page and the different elements that make up the application
- JS - Was used to create a few simple functions for ease of use. Such as changing the date in the footer.
- Python - Used during the development of the back end of the application for everything that communicates with different servers and databases
- Django - Was used as the base development framework. Allowing the use of template and and back end driven development. 
- Bootstrap - Was used to speed up development time due to the vast array of helper classes and systems they have in place. And with the various free templates and code snippets they offer to their users.
- AWS - Used to hose the static files for the application (Media files and Static Files)
- ElephantSQL - Was used for the hosting of the database that contains all the products on the application
- Github - Was used for source control of the project allowing progress of the application to be tracked and stored in one place
- Gitpod - Was used as an IDE. Allowing for the development of the application anywhere anytime
- Heroku - Was used to host the application on the internet for all to use and see

## App Testing

During the development of the Project it has been subjected to different testing methods to ensure that all points are hit. No errors are found in the code as well as manual testing of the app to ensure everything works as intended. There was also testing involved to ensure that the application would be responsive and work on all screen sizes and device types by using the built in google chrome developer tools. To allow for the best accessability possible. The image for this can be found at the top of the document.

## Bugs

During the development of the application there were many different bugs along the way. From a simple syntax error to an application breaking bug. Some of them are in the table below.

## Project Deployment

Heroku was used to deploy the application live to the internet. The live Application can be found [Here](https://ci-localitty-e5ac9cc8af68.herokuapp.com/)

If you are wanting to take a look at the code and potentially add on your own features to the project you can do so by cloning or forking the repo. By doing this it will allow you to locally develop and add your own features to the app.

By clicking the clone repo button. You are able to then clone the repo as it is. By clicking the fork button you are able to take the code and add it to your own account where you can develop and push new and improved features to the main application.

### Code

All code for the project was written by myself. Whilst using Stack Overflow, Google, various Youtube videos and Code Institute Slack Chats for reference and problem solving. Also being aware of the Code Institutes 'Botique Ado' Walkthrough for code reference and guidance along the way

Also using various code samples Bootstrap library of free sample code

### Colors 

The colors that were chosen for the project were picked because they were all simple yet bold colors. All contrasting each other allowing for an easy to read/view application.
